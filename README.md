# Mirage
**WORK IN PROGRESS** | **NOT UPDATED TO LATEST VERSION** | **USE ISSUES FOR UPDATES**

Mirage is a lightweight chat application that prioritizes privacy by not storing messages on the server. It features an easily customizable client and straightforward server hosting using Flask.

## Work In Progress
This project is currently under development. Please note that not all features are fully implemented or up-to-date. The app is functional, but expect significant updates in the coming releases, including code refactoring, new features, and improvements. 

## Features

- **Privacy First**: Messages are never stored on the server permanently, ensuring that your conversations remain private.
- **Customizable Client**: Modify the client as per your needs and preferences.
- **Simple Hosting**: Hosting the Mirage server is easy with Python and Flask, so you can set it up without hassle.
