Mirage is a lightweight chat application that prioritizes privacy by not storing messages on the server. It features an easily customizable client and straightforward server hosting using Flask.

## Features

- **Privacy First**: Messages are never stored on the server permanently , ensuring that your conversations remain private.

# Some bugs

1. The server url is not meant to be opened , that is why you are getting the 404 not found error. You have to run the server.py then run `client.py`
2. You will have to first make a `userinfo.json` file in same folder as `client.py` . Here is what you can paste in it for basic testing
```json
{"username": "user", "email": "user@example.com", "secret_key": "secret"}
```
