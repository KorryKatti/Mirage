To contribute to this project, you must first fork the repository:

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the [Mirage GitHub page](https://github.com/korrykatti/mirage).
2. This will create your own copy of the repository where you can make changes.

### 2. Check Issues

Before making any changes, take a look at the existing [issues](https://github.com/korrykatti/mirage/issues) to see what improvements are needed. 

- **Only work on an existing issue.** If you find something to improve that is not listed, please open a new issue before working on it.
- **No issue assignment is needed**â€”whoever submits a pull request (PR) that solves the issue correctly first will have their PR accepted.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mirage.git
cd mirage
```

Create a new branch for your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

3. Provide a meaningful title and description for your PR, referencing the issue it addresses.

### 5. Review Process

- Your pull request will be reviewed by one of the maintainers.
